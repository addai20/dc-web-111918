# Intro To React

## Challenges With Mod 3 Apps
- manually managing the DOM (creating div, manipulating HTML nodes)
- organizing code (where does my logical go? where does my user interface stuff go?)
- DOM tree organizing (not very modular)
- slow (hard/manually reset the page) feedback loop 

## Creating a React App
- `create-react-app <app_name>`
- `npm install`

## Node, Node Package Manager, package.json

## Webpack and Modular JS

## JSX and Babel
